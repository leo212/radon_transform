# Radon Transform
An implementation of 6 different radon transform algorithms in python
1. Direct slant stack.
2. Parallel beams image rotation.
3. Shear and Sum (SHAS).
4. Two scale recursion.
5. Slow slant stack.
6. Fast slant stack.

The project also provide a web interface for uploading images to the python server and performing the radon transform.
The web interface is written in VueJS using Material design componenets.
